# Promytheus
Tool to view and report acts of aggression worldwide.

Promytheus has yet to be open sourced (we are still ironing some kinks out internally first).
That being said we strong encourage the public to report bugs, request enhancements, and contribute to the content.

We are a small team that cannot do everything.

##We are looking for translations!
To truly benefit and service the entire international community it is important that those that cannot speak English understand the purpose
of our tool.

Our next large goal is to introduce internationalization, in order to do this we need all of static content translated into at least the 
top spoken languages per region.


###What's next?
* Internationalization (see above).
* Enhanced mobile user interaction (maybe native versions?)
